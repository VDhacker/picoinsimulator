# This will explain you how to use this simulator


- 1: Mining

first, go to the miner.exe, in the app, if u have promo codes, enter them and summit, they can be used once the app resets,
Then click on start mining, your picoins will start coming, and you can also see your mining speed, promo codes increase it.
You can quit any time.


- 2: Price Update

then, after mining, go to the price_updater.exe,
it will generate a price for you, now you can close this app.


- 3: Sell

Now, go to sell.exe, then, you can see your money (it will be zero if you haven't used the sell app yet), picoin and the price,
Click on Are you sure??? Button, then your Picoin will become Zero, but your money will increase.
### WARNING: Do not click on the are you sure button many times since we do not have any more picoin, the app will make our money to 0.
